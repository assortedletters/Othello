Simple two player othello/reversi game.
AI is dumb. Just performs first available move
Can generalize size of game. Default is 8x8

Potential inputs:
Othello() begins standard 8x8 2-player game
Othello(String difficulty) standard 8x8 with computer play. Only one difficulty, so any string will work
Othello(int width) starts a square 2-player game with width as given
Othello(int width, int height) rectangular 2-player game


Have fun,
